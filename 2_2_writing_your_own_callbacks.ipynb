        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "A callback is a powerful tool to customize the behavior of a Keras model during training, evaluation, or inference. Examples include tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard to visualize training progress and results with TensorBoard, or tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint to periodically save your model during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this guide, you will learn what a Keras callback is, what it can do, and how you can build your own. We provide a few demos of simple callback applications to get you started.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Keras callbacks overview**\n",
        "All callbacks subclass the keras.callbacks.Callback class, and override a set of methods called at various stages of training, testing, and predicting. Callbacks are useful to get a view on internal states and statistics of the model during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can pass a list of callbacks (as the keyword argument callbacks) to the following model methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. keras.Model.fit()\n",
        "2. keras.Model.evaluate()\n",
        "3. keras.Model.predict()\n",
        "\n",
        "## **An overview of callback methods**\n",
        "### **Global methods**\n",
        "**on_(train|test|predict)_begin(self, logs=None)**\n",
        "Called at the beginning of fit/evaluate/predict.\n",
        "\n",
        "**on_(train|test|predict)_end(self, logs=None)**\n",
        "Called at the end of fit/evaluate/predict.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Batch-level methods for training/testing/predicting**\n",
        "**on_(train|test|predict)_batch_begin(self, batch, logs=None)**\n",
        "Called right before processing a batch during training/testing/predicting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**on_(train|test|predict)_batch_end(self, batch, logs=None)**\n",
        "Called at the end of training/testing/predicting a batch. Within this method, logs is a dict containing the metrics results.\n",

        "### **Epoch-level methods (training only)**\n",
        "**on_epoch_begin(self, epoch, logs=None)**\n",
        "Called at the beginning of an epoch during training.\n",
